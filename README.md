# Live Code Editor & Preview Tool

## 📋 Description
This project is a lightweight web-based live code editor that allows you to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. Using the powerful [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), the interface splits into three editors for each language and a preview pane to instantly render the combined code.

The editor supports writing code in separate panels and shows the result inside an iframe when you click the "Ажилуулах" (Run) button.

## ⚙️ Features
- Three separate Monaco Editor instances for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Real-time preview of combined code on button click
- Clean, responsive UI with a navbar and flexible layout
- Dark-themed code editor panels for comfortable coding
